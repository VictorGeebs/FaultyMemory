# Changelog
All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

## [0.1.0] - 2020-07-01
### Added
- Clusters are now in charge of storing the saved and perturbed tensors.
- Tensors can now be added to clusters independently of which module they belong to
- Tensors can be batch-added and batch-removed by module with cluster.add_module() and remove_module()
- Default initializer for clusters and modules in the handler with handler.init_clusters()

### Changed
- All occurences of "model" changed to "module" in non-deprecated classes corrected for consistency
- Cluster's perturb_module and save_module changed to perturb_tensors and save_tensors to better represent the action
- Minor format change of the TODO list

### Deprecated
- Wrappers are now deprecated since memory management is done through the clusters themselves
- the Cluster class is now deprecated, being replaced with TensorCluster. This is temporary and the name TensorCluster will change back to Cluster once Cluster is removed

### Fixed
- Minor formating issue when printing out classes



## [0.1.1] - 2020-07-02
### Added
- Clusters now handle hooking for activations themselves
- There is no longer a differentiation between Perturbations for only tensors or activations
- Handler access for the new cluster activation functions 

### Changed
- The old "TensorCluster" class is now called "Cluster" with the removal of the old Cluster class

### Removed
- Wrappers have been removed
- Activation Perturbations have been removed, they are now all simply Perturbations
