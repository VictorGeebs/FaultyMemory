- [X] Re-write architecture: with a per-tensor access, there is no longer a use for layer wrappers. The clusters can save the correct parameters themselves.
- [X] Distinguish Clusters from activation perturbations -> if clusters only represent memory and contain tensors, it doesnt make sense they perturb activations of layers as a whole. 
- [X] Make test functions
- [X] Make graph generators
- [X] Make sign inverter perturbation
- [X] Add recursive network hook for activations
- [X] Add representation class to distinguish perturbation types from representations
- [X] Implement a Json/UI loader to save configurations and assign tensors and modules more easily
- [X] JSON saver
- [X] Prune useless function
- [X] Extend documentation
- [ ] Make automated tests for the API itself
- [ ] Change clusters to deal with correlations
- [ ] Fixed-point representation
- [ ] Make functions list-agnostic (dont have to pass perturbs as lists of length 1)
- [ ] Make additional test networks -> MNIST, multiple representations
- [ ] JSON load by class type (Perturb all conv2d)
- [ ] Profiling of execute time
- [ ] Use other lib than numpy
- [ ] Write C function with numpy plugin
- [ ] Handler perturb toggle
- [ ] Backprop perturb
- [ ] Utils test_acc resampling with same pert
- [ ] Quantization - he scaling - mean scaling
- [ ] Clustering - dont worry about it
