1. Re-write architecture: with a per-tensor access, there is no longer a use for layer wrappers. The clusters can save the correct parameters themselves.
2. Distinguish Clusters from activation perturbations -> if clusters only represent memory and contain tensors, it doesnt make sense they perturb activations of layers as a whole.
