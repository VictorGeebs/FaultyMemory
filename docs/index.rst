FaultyMemory is a library built on top of Pytorch that aims to facilitate the emulation of hardware constraints on a machine learning task.

Feature list
==================
* arbitrary quantization (in dev.): forward and backward propagate an arbitrary quantization for quantization aware training
* bitwise faults (in dev.): forward and backward propagate dynamically sampled bitwise faults for fault aware training

on any tensors.
